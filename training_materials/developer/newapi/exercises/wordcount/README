Simple classes to find word counts over a directory of text files using Hadoop.

The source files are:

  WordCount.java
    - A simple driver class.
  WordCountWTool.java
     - A variant of the driver class that accepts enhanced "generic options".
  WordMapper.java
     - The mapper for both drivers.
  SumReducer.java
     - The reducer for both drivers.

To compile these 4 Java classes (ignore deprecation notes):

  $ javac -classpath $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop*core.jar *.java


To create the jar file for running hadoop jobs:

  $ jar cvf wc.jar -C . *.class


To run the conventional WordCount driver against HDFS:

  $ hadoop jar wc.jar WordCount <input dir>  <output dir>


To run WordCountWTool with the local filesystem and local jobrunner:

  $ hadoop jar wc.jar WordCountWTool -fs file:/// -jt local <input dir>  <output dir>
